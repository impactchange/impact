# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "COLLABORATION FEATURES TESTING COMPLETED: All collaboration endpoints are working correctly. GET /api/projects/assigned endpoint returns properly structured response with assigned_projects array, total_count, and user_id. Response includes project details with user_role for each assigned project. GET /api/projects/{project_id}/activities endpoint returns comprehensive activity feed with project_id, activities array, total_count, page, and page_size for pagination. Activity logging system is functional and tracks user actions with proper timestamps, user_id, action, and details fields. Real-time collaboration workflow supports project team visibility and activity tracking. All collaboration endpoints require proper authentication but work for all authenticated users (not just admins)."

All admin endpoints are properly secured with authentication and authorization - only admin users can access admin features, non-admin users receive proper 403 Forbidden responses. User registration with approval workflow is working correctly - new users get 'pending_approval' status and cannot login until approved by admin. Admin dashboard provides proper statistics (total_users, pending_approvals, active_projects, total_assessments). User management supports pagination and filtering. User approval workflow allows approve/reject actions. Project assignment and viewing features work correctly. Collaboration features (assigned projects and project activities) work for all authenticated users. Activity logging tracks user actions properly. All endpoints have proper error handling and response structures. Backend is production-ready for admin center and collaboration features. Frontend implementation can proceed with confidence in backend API stability."
