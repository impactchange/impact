## Executive Summary
Your organization shows an overall readiness score of {overall_score:.1f}/5 for Manufacturing EAM implementation. 
Readiness Level: **{readiness_level}**

**Key Principle**: You can't have manufacturing excellence without maintenance excellence.

## Manufacturing Excellence Assessment
- **Maintenance-Operations Alignment**: {dimension_scores.get('maintenance_operations_alignment', 'N/A')}/5
- **Manufacturing Constraints Management**: {dimension_scores.get('manufacturing_constraints', 'N/A')}/5
- **Technical Infrastructure Readiness**: {dimension_scores.get('technical_readiness', 'N/A')}/5
- **Safety Compliance Integration**: {dimension_scores.get('safety_compliance', 'N/A')}/5

## Newton's Laws Application to Manufacturing
- **Organizational Inertia**: {manufacturing_analysis.get('inertia', {}).get('value', 0)} - {manufacturing_analysis.get('inertia', {}).get('interpretation', 'Unknown')}
- **Required Implementation Force**: {manufacturing_analysis.get('force', {}).get('required', 0)} units
- **Expected Resistance**: {manufacturing_analysis.get('reaction', {}).get('resistance', 0)} units

## IMPACT Phase Recommendations
Based on your readiness assessment, focus areas for each phase:

**Investigate & Assess**: Deepen understanding of maintenance-operations disconnects
**Mobilize & Prepare**: Build strong champion network across all shifts  
**Pilot & Adapt**: Select pilot area that demonstrates maintenance excellence impact
**Activate & Deploy**: Emphasize maintenance-manufacturing performance connection
**Cement & Transfer**: Embed maintenance excellence in organizational culture
**Track & Optimize**: Continuously demonstrate manufacturing performance gains

## Manufacturing-Specific Recommendations
1. Strengthen maintenance-operations collaboration through cross-functional teams
2. Address shift work coordination challenges with dedicated communication strategies
3. Leverage existing safety culture to drive maintenance excellence adoption
4. Ensure technical readiness through comprehensive training programs
5. Demonstrate clear connection between maintenance improvements and manufacturing KPIs

## Implementation Guarantee Eligibility
Based on current readiness: {'Eligible' if overall_score >= 3.0 else 'Requires Improvement'}

This assessment provides the foundation for your DigitalThinker Manufacturing EAM implementation success."""
