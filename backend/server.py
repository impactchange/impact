## Executive Summary
Your organization shows an overall readiness score of {overall_score:.1f}/5 for {type_name.lower()} projects.
Readiness Level: **{readiness_level}**

## Newton's Laws Application
- **Organizational Inertia**: {analysis_data['inertia']['value']} - {analysis_data['inertia']['interpretation']}
- **Required Force**: {analysis_data['force']['required']} units
- **Expected Resistance**: {analysis_data['reaction']['resistance']} units

## IMPACT Phase Recommendations
Based on your readiness assessment, focus areas for each phase:

**Investigate & Assess**: Understand current state and stakeholder landscape
**Mobilize & Prepare**: Build strong foundation and prepare resources
**Pilot & Adapt**: Test approach and refine strategies
**Activate & Deploy**: Execute with comprehensive support
**Cement & Transfer**: Institutionalize changes and transfer ownership
**Track & Optimize**: Monitor success and continuous improvement

## Strategic Recommendations
1. Focus on strengthening lowest-scoring dimensions
2. Build comprehensive stakeholder engagement strategy
3. Develop targeted training and communication programs
4. Establish clear success metrics and monitoring systems
5. Create change champion network for peer support

This assessment provides the foundation for your DigitalThinker implementation success."""

        EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
        Your organization shows an overall readiness score of {avg_score:.1f}/5 for change initiatives.

        NEWTON'S LAWS INSIGHTS:
        - Organizational inertia is {newton_data['inertia']['interpretation'].lower()} based on current readiness
        - Force required: {newton_data['force']['description'].lower()}
        - Expected resistance: {newton_data['reaction']['description'].lower()}

        STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS:
        1. Focus on strengthening the lowest-scoring assessment dimension
        2. Implement gradual change approach to overcome inertia
        3. Build strong communication channels for change management
        4. Engage leadership early and consistently
        5. Prepare comprehensive training and support programs

## Executive Summary
Your organization shows an overall readiness score of {overall_score:.1f}/5 for Manufacturing EAM implementation. 
Readiness Level: **{readiness_level}**

**Key Principle**: You can't have manufacturing excellence without maintenance excellence.

## Manufacturing Excellence Assessment
- **Maintenance-Operations Alignment**: {dimension_scores.get('maintenance_operations_alignment', 'N/A')}/5
- **Manufacturing Constraints Management**: {dimension_scores.get('manufacturing_constraints', 'N/A')}/5
- **Technical Infrastructure Readiness**: {dimension_scores.get('technical_readiness', 'N/A')}/5
- **Safety Compliance Integration**: {dimension_scores.get('safety_compliance', 'N/A')}/5

## Newton's Laws Application to Manufacturing
- **Organizational Inertia**: {manufacturing_analysis.get('inertia', {}).get('value', 0)} - {manufacturing_analysis.get('inertia', {}).get('interpretation', 'Unknown')}
- **Required Implementation Force**: {manufacturing_analysis.get('force', {}).get('required', 0)} units
- **Expected Resistance**: {manufacturing_analysis.get('reaction', {}).get('resistance', 0)} units

## IMPACT Phase Recommendations
Based on your readiness assessment, focus areas for each phase:

**Investigate & Assess**: Deepen understanding of maintenance-operations disconnects
**Mobilize & Prepare**: Build strong champion network across all shifts  
**Pilot & Adapt**: Select pilot area that demonstrates maintenance excellence impact
**Activate & Deploy**: Emphasize maintenance-manufacturing performance connection
**Cement & Transfer**: Embed maintenance excellence in organizational culture
**Track & Optimize**: Continuously demonstrate manufacturing performance gains

## Manufacturing-Specific Recommendations
1. Strengthen maintenance-operations collaboration through cross-functional teams
2. Address shift work coordination challenges with dedicated communication strategies
3. Leverage existing safety culture to drive maintenance excellence adoption
4. Ensure technical readiness through comprehensive training programs
5. Demonstrate clear connection between maintenance improvements and manufacturing KPIs

## Implementation Guarantee Eligibility
Based on current readiness: {'Eligible' if overall_score >= 3.0 else 'Requires Improvement'}

This assessment provides the foundation for your DigitalThinker Manufacturing EAM implementation success."""
